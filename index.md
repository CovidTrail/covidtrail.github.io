## Overview

Covid Trail is a web application for UH students, faculty, and staff to check in on their symptoms for COVID-19.

It is designed after the LumiSight UH application:

* Users can sign up or login.
* Users can check in regarding their symptoms, and update it accordingly.
* Users can upload their vaccination cards and vaccine card information

### Submit Vaccination Information

This page allows users to submit all pertinent information about their current vaccination status. Begin by selecting the type of the vaccine that you have received. If you only have one shot type then you are only shown the fields for one-shots worth of information.

Additionally, if you only have a one shot variant you will only be shown the first shot information fields.
